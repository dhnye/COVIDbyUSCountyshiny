Link: https://hullnye2.shinyapps.io/covidshinyapp/



Description:

Four Plots: Cumulative Cases since beginning of Pandemic, Cumulative Deaths since beginning of Pandemic, New Daily Cases, New Daily Deaths


Data taken from: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data

Data reads for last 30 days automatically

Most counties do not report on weekends so you will see "0"s there and any weekend cases added to Monday's counts.

You can delete name in Drop down menu and start typing state/county that you want. 

You can change time range for plots to any range in last 30 days.


Advantages: (1) Can change plots based on needed time frame in last 30 days, (2) Up to date for recent COVID trends, (3) By County not just State, (4) Nice plots using Bar Plots for easy viewing of data
